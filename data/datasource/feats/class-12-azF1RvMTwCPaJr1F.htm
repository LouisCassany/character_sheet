Attempt to [[/act tumble-through]] a creature at least one size category larger than you, using the following effects.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> You move through the enemy's space, treating the squares in its space as difficult terrain (every 5 feet costs 10 feet of movement). If you don't have enough Speed to move all the way through its space, you get the same effect as a failure. If you successfully pass through the target's square, the target gains weakness to your precision damage equal to half your level, which lasts until the end of your turn.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> As success, but the weakness applies only against the next attack you make against the target.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> Your movement ends, and you trigger reactions as if you had moved out of the square you started in.</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> As failure, and you fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone}.</p>
