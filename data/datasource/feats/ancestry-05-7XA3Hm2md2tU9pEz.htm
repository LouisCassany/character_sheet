<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p>It's said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that the flesh of the left side is deadly and poisonous. You deal @Damage[1[slashing]] damage to yourself to poison a weapon you are holding. If you hit with the weapon and deal damage, the target also takes @Damage[1d4[persistent,poison]] damage. The poison on your weapon becomes inert after you hit, or at the end of your next turn, whichever comes first.</p>
