<p>You've set your mind on learning more about your ancestor and their kin, and perhaps you were even raised by a dragon parent. You've come to understand how dragons can invoke fear but also how they've contributed to society as a whole. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Diplomacy and Intimidation. If you would automatically become trained in one of those skills (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice.</p>
<p>You also gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.BocFD2KV0qgUC76x]{Additional Lore} general feat for Dragon Lore.</p>
