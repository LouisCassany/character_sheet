<p><strong>Frequency</strong> once per hour</p><hr /><p>You let out an ear-piercing screech. Each creature in a @Template[emanation|distance:10] takes @Damage[ceil(@actor.level/2)d6[sonic]] damage, with a @Check[fortitude|against:class-spell|basic] saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC. You then Stride, and this movement doesn't trigger reactions from any creature that failed or critically failed its saving throw.</p>
