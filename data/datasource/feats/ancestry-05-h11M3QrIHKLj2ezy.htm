<p>You are fastidious about keeping clean. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease, you get a critical success instead. If you have a different ability that would improve the save in this way (such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.gdSmSTaGDxf4g2d8]{Battle Hardened} fighter class feature), if you roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.</p>
