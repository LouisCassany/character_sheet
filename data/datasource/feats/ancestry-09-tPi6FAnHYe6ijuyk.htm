<p>You have a pair of draconic wings strong enough to batter your foes away and shove them away. Choose up to two creatures adjacent to you. Attempt an @Check[athletics|defense:fortitude] check and compare it to the Fortitude DC of each target. This counts as two attacks for your multiple attack penalty, but the penalty doesn't increase until after both attacks.</p><hr /><p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to double your level (@Damage[2*@actor.level[bludgeoning]]) and is pushed up to 10 feet away from you.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to your level (@Damage[@actor.level[bludgeoning]]) and is pushed up to 5 feet away from you.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> The target takes bludgeoning damage equal to half your level (@Damage[(floor(@actor.level/2))[bludgeoning]]).</p>
<p><strong>Critical Failure</strong> You fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.j91X7x0XSomq8d60]{Prone} at the end of this activity.</p>
