<p>Like some dragons, your forebear had the supernatural ability to change their shape to walk among humanoids. You have learned how to mimic this ability. You can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.2qGqa33E4GPUCbMV]{Humanoid Form} as a 5th-rank innate spell once per day, except that the duration is increased to 1 hour. The spell's tradition matches your draconic exemplar's.</p>
