<p>You can add a toxic additive to an alchemical poison to make it splash poison on its target. A poison with this additive deals an amount of poison damage equal to the poison's level if the target succeeds at its initial saving throw against it. A target that critically succeeds at its saving throw against this poison still takes no damage.</p>
