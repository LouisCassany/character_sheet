<p>The ancestral spirits you commune with haunt you and meddle with your belongings and actions, either out of a wellintentioned (but ultimately detrimental) attempt to assist you, as punishment for your audacity in circumventing the traditional means of achieving divine power, for their own amusement, or a mixture of the above. When you have the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zXZjC8HLaRoLR17U]{Cursebound} condition, you are @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.i3OJZU2nk64Df3xm]{Clumsy} with a value equal to your cursebound value as the spirits of your ancestors temporarily possess you and vie for control in your mind, hindering your movements.</p>
