<p><strong>Critical Success</strong> The target gains agency over fate and chance while in the pursuit of their goal, gaining a "wild card." Randomly determine a harrow suit, either by rolling 1d6 or by drawing a card from a full harrow deck, and then consult the Associated Suit Checks table below. At any point during <em>harrowing</em>'s duration, the creature can expend this wild card to immediately reroll any associated check they just made, gaining a +4 status bonus to the reroll. They must use the second result. Once this reroll is taken and the wild card is spent, the <em>harrowing</em> ritual's effects end.</p>
<p><strong>Success</strong> As critical success, but the wild card does not grant a status bonus to the reroll.</p>
<p><strong>Failure</strong> As success, but the wild card instead grants a –4 status penalty to the reroll.</p>
