<p><strong>Requirements</strong> You are under the effects of a mutagen.</p><hr /><p>You redirect a mutagen within your body to spit a stream of stomach acid at a foe. A creature within 30 feet takes @Damage[1d6[acid]] damage for every 2 levels you have, with a @Check[reflex|against:alchemist|basic] save against your class DC. On a failure, the creature is also @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 1} (or @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fesd1n5eVhpCSS18]{Sickened 2} on a critical failure). The mutagen's duration immediately ends.</p>
