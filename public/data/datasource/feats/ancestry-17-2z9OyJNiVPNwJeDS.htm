<p>Whenever you successfully Strike a creature that has not acted in the first round of combat, that creature is @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.AJh5ex99aV6VTggg]{Off-Guard} until the end of your next turn. If that creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points before the end of your next turn, you and all allies within 30 feet of the creature become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.nlCjDvLMf2EkV2dl]{Quickened} until the end of your next turn. You can use the extra action only to Step, Stride, or Strike.</p>
