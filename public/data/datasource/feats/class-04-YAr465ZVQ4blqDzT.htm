<p>Those you shield can benefit from your lasting protection. You can cast @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.ZL97DcoJ8us6EwAF]{Shields of the Spirit} using 2 actions instead of 1. If you do, you can choose one ally in your champion's aura to gain a spirit shield that accompanies it. For 1 minute, that ally gains the benefits of shields of the spirit, even while the ally isn't in your champion's aura and even if your shield isn't raised. If you create another companion shield, any previous one ends.</p>
