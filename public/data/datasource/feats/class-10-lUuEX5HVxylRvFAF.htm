<p>Your lips murmur as you portend a great disaster, one you hope you survive. A rain of blazing bolts begins to fall from the heavens in a @Template[emanation|distance:10], centered on you, that deals @Damage[2d6[fire]|traits:area-damage] damage to all creatures in the emanation at the end of each of your turns (@Check[reflex|against:class-spell|basic] save); you can't exclude yourself from the emanation. The skyfire persists for 1 minute; while you can't Dismiss it, you can suppress the effect for 1 round with a Sustain action. The rain of fire is suppressed if you fall @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.fBnFDH2MTzgFijKf]{Unconscious}. If you become @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.conditionitems.Item.zXZjC8HLaRoLR17U]{Cursebound 3} or 4 at any point during Trial by Skyfire's duration, the emanation increases to @Template[emanation|distance:15]{15 feet} and the damage increases to @Damage[4d6[fire]|traits:area-damage|shortLabel:true].</p>
