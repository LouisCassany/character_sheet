<p>Your blood contains a tiny fragment of unusual or inexplicable power from a mysterious dragon, such as a conspirator dragon or omen dragon. You are drawn to the stranger parts of the world and can generally spot them with a glance. You gain the trained proficiency rank in Occultism. If you would automatically become trained in Occultism (from your background or class, for example), you instead become trained in a skill of your choice. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.hDGosy2ZTwnyctEP]{Oddity Identification} skill feat. If you choose a draconic exemplar, you must choose an occult dragon.</p>
