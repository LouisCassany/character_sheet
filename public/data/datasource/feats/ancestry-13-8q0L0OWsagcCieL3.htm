-- Desc (en) --
<p>Whenever an enemy starts its turn adjacent to you, it must attempt a Will saving throw against your class DC or spell DC, whichever is highest. On a failure, the enemy takes a –1 status penalty to attack rolls and skill checks for as long as it remains adjacent to you. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is then temporarily immune to bonekeeper's bane for 24 hours.</p>
