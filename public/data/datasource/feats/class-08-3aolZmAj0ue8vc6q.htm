<p>Shield in hand, you offer your ally its full protection you do yourself. While the companion shield is in effect, if your shield is raised, the ally with the companion shield gets the same bonus to AC your shield grants, and you can trigger @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.feats-srd.Item.jM72TjJ965jocBV8]{Shield Block} if that ally would meet the trigger. This uses your shield's statistics and applies damage to your shield.</p>
