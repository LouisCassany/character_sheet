<p>Your diet has strengthened you against diseases and poisons. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against diseases and poisons. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead. If you have a different ability that would improve the save in this way (such as the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.classfeatures.Item.gdSmSTaGDxf4g2d8]{Battle Hardened} fighter class feature), if you roll a critical failure on the save you get a failure instead.</p>
