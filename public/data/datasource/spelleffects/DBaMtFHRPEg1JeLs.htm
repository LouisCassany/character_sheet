<p>Powerful wards hide a creature from magic that would spy on it or affect its mind. The target gains a +4 status bonus to saves against mental effects. <em>Hidden mind</em> attempts to counteract any detection, revelation, and scrying effects as if its spell rank were 1 higher than its actual rank. On a success, the effect functions normally except that it detects nothing about the target and its possessions. For instance, <em>detect magic</em> would still detect other magic in the area, but not any magic on the target.</p>
