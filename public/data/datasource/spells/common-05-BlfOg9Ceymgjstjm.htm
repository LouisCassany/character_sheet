<p><strong>Area</strong> all squares in two @Template[burst|distance:10]{10-foot bursts}.</p><hr /><p>You create two puddles of acidic slime that hinders the movement of anyone who walks through it. The area of each pool becomes greater difficult terrain. Each round that a creature starts its turn in one of the pools or enters a pool during a move action it's using, it takes 8d6 acid damage with a basic Reflex save. A creature that critically fails its saving throw also takes @Damage[1d6[acid,persistent]]. As normal, if a Large or larger creature starts its turn in both pools, it takes the damage only once.</p><hr /><p><strong>Heightened (+2)</strong> Create an additional 10-foot burst.</p>
