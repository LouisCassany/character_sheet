<p>You can mix special ingredients into your vials, such as magical dust or flakes of precious minerals. When you create a versatile vial, you can choose to have it treated as one special material of your choice, chosen from adamantine, cold iron, and dawnsilver. If you're wearing or wielding an item of a different precious material when you make the vial, you can choose that material instead.</p>
