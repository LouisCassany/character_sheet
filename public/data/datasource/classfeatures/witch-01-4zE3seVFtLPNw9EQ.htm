<p>Wings and swirling winds announced the approach of your patron. The wings might have been radiantly feathered, jeweled like a dragonfly's, strangely mechanical, or leathery with the scent of sulfur, but the controlled chaos of their movements contained countless teachings.</p>
<p><strong>Spell List</strong> primal</p>
<p><strong>Patron Skill</strong> Nature</p>
<p><strong>Lesson of the Observed Sky</strong> Your patron teaches that the sky can guide you anywhere you let it. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.4EmLum6EdvXxbxCj]{Murmuration} hex cantrip, and your familiar learns @UUID[Compendium.pf2e.spells-srd.Item.TTwOKGqmZeKSyNMH]{Gentle Landing}.</p>
<p><strong>Familiar of Nimble Flight</strong> Even if your familiar doesn't have wings, it can sometimes move as if carried aloft by the wind. When you Cast or Sustain a hex, your familiar can Fly up to 15 feet; this movement doesn't trigger reactions.</p>
